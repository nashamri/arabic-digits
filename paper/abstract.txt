Evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks on Handwritten Arabic Digits Dataset

The task of recognizing handwritten digits is a well-established and important research area in machine and deep learning and many research efforts has been dedicate to it. However, recognizing handwritten Arabic digits is lacking compared to their English counterparts. In this study, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten Arabic digits. We evaluated the accuracy of the model using MADBase dataset, which is an Arabic dataset that resembles the famous MNIST dataset. MADBase consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The accuracy of our model reaches 99.35% which could be considered state-of-the-art accuracy amount currently published models that use MADBase.
